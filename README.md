# 30DaysOfJavaScript

JavaScript is a high-level programming language that is widely used to create dynamic and interactive web pages. It is a client-side scripting language, meaning that it is executed on the user's web browser rather than on the server. JavaScript allows developers to create interactive web elements such as animations, pop-ups, and forms, and it can also be used to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page, allowing for the modification of the page's content and structure. Additionally, JavaScript can be used on the server-side, allowing for the development of full-stack web applications. JavaScript is supported by all modern web browsers and is an essential component of web development.
